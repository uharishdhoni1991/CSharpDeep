Day 2 - Exploring Data Types
For this challenge, you need to read a line from stdin and check whether it is of type integer, float or string. If input is- Integer print 'This input is of type Integer.' to the stdout Float print 'This input is of type Float.' to the stdout String print 'This input is of type string.' to the stdout else print 'This is something else.' to the stdout.

Day 3 - Play with Operators
For this challenge, you will be given the values of principal, interest and year. You need to calculate the simple interest, round it to the nearest integer and print it.

Day 4 - Decide yourself with conditional statement
For this challenge, you need to read a integer value(default name - age) from stdin, store it in a variable and then compare that value with the conditions given below

if age is less than 10, then print 'I am happy as having no responsibilities.' to the stdout.
if age is equal to or greater than 10 but less than 18, then print 'I am still happy but starts feeling pressure of life.' to the stdout.
if age is equal to or greater than 18, then print 'I am very much happy as i handled the pressure very well.' to the stdout.
Day 5 - Loop your World
For this challenge, you need to take an integer value as input from stdin, calculate its factorial and print the result to the stdout. 1

Day 6 - How Much Big Is Your Number
For this challenge, you will take an integer input from stdin, store it in a variable and calculate the number of digits in the number using division operator.

Day 7 - Count special numbers between boundaries
For this challenge, you are given a range and you need to find how many prime numbers lying between the given range.

Day 8 - Is your Number Armstrong?
For this challenge, you need to take an integer input and store it in a variable of your choice and checks whether this number is an Armstrong number or not. If yes print 'True' else print 'False'.

Day 9 - Is Your Number Narcissistic?
For this challenge, you will take an integer input and store it in a variable and checks whether the input number is a Narcissistic number or not. If it is, then print 'True' else print 'False'.

Day 10 - Who's the second largest?
For this challenge, you need to take number of elements as input on one line and array elements as an input on another line and find the second largest array element and print that element to the stdout.

Day 11 - Count the letters For this challenge, you need to take a string as an input from the stdin, count the number of uppercase and lowercase letters and print them to the stdout.

Day 12 - Patch Up Two Matrices
For this challenge, you need to take 2 matrices as an input from the stdin , add them and print the resultant matrix to the stdout.

Day 13 - Roll your matrix
For this challenge, you need to take a matrix as an input from the stdin , transpose it and print the resultant matrix to the stdout.

Day 14 - Lets make a dictionary order
You need to input N words one on each line and output should be lexicographically sorted i.e the words which comes as a output should be lexicographically sorted.

Day 15 - Calculate power using Recursion
This program takes two integers from user ( base number and a exponent) and calculates the power. Instead of using loops to calculate power, this program uses recursion to calculate the power of a number.

Day 16 - GCD of two numbers
For this challenge, you need to take input of two numbers , calculate their greatest common divisor (GCD) and print it to the stdout.

Day 17 - Find pairs
For this challenge, you need to take array and an integer as an input, check for pair in array with sum as that of an integer and if you find those two numbers in the array return true else return false.

Day 18 - Minimum effort - Maximum output
For this challenge, Given an unsorted array arr[0..n-1] of size n, find the minimum length subarray arr[s..e] such that sorting this subarray makes the whole array sorted.

Day 19 - Binary To Decimal
You will be getting a binary number as an input and you need to convert it into a decimal number.

Day 20 - Square making
You need to print the following pattern

* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
Day 21 - Multiplication between odd and even
For this challenge, you need to take number of elements as input on one line and array elements as an input on another line. You need to find the numbers that are odd, add them. find the numbers that are even add them and then multiply the two values that you get after addition of even numbers and that of addition of odd numbers.

Day 22 - War between odd and even
For this challenge, you need to take number of elements as input on one line and array elements as an input on another line. You need to find the numbers that are present at odd index, add them. find the numbers that are present at even index, add them and then subtract the smallest of the two values from the lager one.

Day 23 - Maximum Vs Minimum
For this challenge, you need to take number of elements as input on one line and array elements as an input on another line. You need to find the minimum number and maximum number from the array and multiply them.

Day 24 - Play With Average
For this challenge, you need to take number of elements as input on one line and array elements as an input on another line. You need to find the average of even numbers, then the average of odd numbers and add them (round the averages to the nearest integers).

Day 25 - Consecutive!!!
For this challenge, you need to take number of elements as input on one line and array elements as an input on another line. You need to tell whether the numbers present in the array are consecutive or not.

Day 26 - Biggest Digit In A Number
For this challenge, you will take an integer input from stdin, store it in a variable, find the digits in a number and then print the biggest of them.

Day 27 - Play with digits of a number
For this challenge, you will take an integer input from stdin, store it in a variable, find the digits in that number, identify digits that are odd and add them, identify which digits are even and add them. Subtract the smaller with the larger one.

Day 28 - Compare two numbers
For this challenge, you will take two integers input from stdin, sum the digits of a number and same is to be done with another number. Then compare the sum of the digits of two numbers and if one sum found to be greater then print that number to the stdout. If found both sum to be equal then print 'Equal' to the stdout.
