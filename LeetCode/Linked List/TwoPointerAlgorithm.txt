* If there is a loop containing n nodes, then once a pointer has entered the loop it will remain there forever !
* So we can introduce another pointer and move both the pointers until they meet.
* Lets assume initial values for pointers (modulo n) as a and b. Condition for pointers to meet after t steps is then
	
	a+t ≡ b+2t mod n

	which equates to t = a-b mod n

	This will work as long as difference doesn't share prime factors with n.
